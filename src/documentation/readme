IN this applicatino we'll talk to chatgpt to make our answers. Chatgpt provides a public api, using which we can call its api

let's look at api endpoint request and response structure and we'l implement it

1. goto homepage of openapi
2. api reference section
3. authentication section - open api uses api keys for authentication.
4 .we can pass this API key as a token while invoking any api
5. before this lets look at response/response - goto playground section - ask a question
    now to visualize how this request will goto chatgpt, what should be the endpoint/what should be the request format,
    -> click on view code button in playground ->you will find the curl command -> copy this call ->
    goto postman -> import -> raw text -> check body , it will contain the message we type in questions page (called promt)
    -> in headers section well see as part of authorization header we are giving the bearer token, this is nothing but
    openAPI token. -> to generate this token - acount - api keys -create new secret key- typr anything and get it
    -> this token will act as a authorization header
